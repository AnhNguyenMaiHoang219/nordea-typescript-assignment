# nordea-typescript-assignment

A simple web application for transforming raw music band data

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 20.10](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)

## Framework and technologies

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): Code formatter

## Side notes

Something went wrong in the assignment's sorting order requirements (5.3 & 5.4).
The sorting order should be sorted by band's member name first, then sorted by band's member age later, to achieve the expected result.
